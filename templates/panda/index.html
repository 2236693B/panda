			Welcome to Panda <br>
			This is a place for you to meet like minded games <br>
			You can find gamers with similar interests to yourself <br>
			and play with them on your chosen platforms!! <br>
			You can even rate the other players based on how well <br>
			they performed in game, were they greedy? Or did they share the loot? <br>
			Feel free to rate the games as well, let other players know <br>
			what they're getting into before they buy it!! <br>
			
			Enjoy!
